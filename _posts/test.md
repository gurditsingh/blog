## What is Delta Lake?

In the past there are different storage solutions build to solve the common problem of data quality. Many architecture/tools are build to solve the problem. These tools provides many benefits like decoupling the business logic from storage and  

As previously noted, over time, there have been different storage solutions built to solve this problem of data quality - from databases to data lakes. The transition from databases to data lakes had the benefit of decoupling business logic from storage as well as the ability to independently scale compute and storage. But lost in this transi‚Äê tion was ensuring data reliability. Providing data reliability to data lakes led to the development of Delta Lake.
