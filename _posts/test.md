## Problem
Data engineering pipeline often go wrong when dirty/bad data ingested from the external sources. After that it is hard to undo changes or updates in the data lake. In addition to that there are aspects like data auditing and understand how the data is changed over the time.


Data engineering pipelines often go awry, especially when ingesting “dirty” data from external systems. However, in a traditional data lake design, it is hard to undo updates that added objects into a table. In addition, it is challenging to audit data changes which are critical, both in terms of data compliance as well as simple debugging, to understand how data has changed over time.
