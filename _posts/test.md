## Problem
Data engineering pipeline 
Data engineering pipelines often go awry, especially when ingesting “dirty” data from external systems. However, in a traditional data lake design, it is hard to undo updates that added objects into a table. In addition, it is challenging to audit data changes which are critical, both in terms of data compliance as well as simple debugging, to understand how data has changed over time.
