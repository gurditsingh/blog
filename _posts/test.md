 - **Data serialization** also determines a good network performance. You will be able to obtain good results in Spark performance by serialization. Spark supports two serialization libraries Java Serialization, Kryo Serialization.
 - **Memory Tuning** is necessary or important step in tuning. we need to give as much memory so that the entire dataset has to fit in memory.
 -  **Data Structure Tuning**
