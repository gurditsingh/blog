Functional programming languages, like Scala, we make it possible to ensure immutability, referential transparency and DRY.
 
In functional programming, **Immutability** is a must. Whenever it is needed to modify the content of a data structure, a new instance with updated values is created. Immutable objects and data structures are first-class citizens in Scala. This is because they prevent mistakes in distributed systems and provide thread-safe data.

In functional programming, **Referential Transparency** is a must. It means An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the programâ€™s behavior.
