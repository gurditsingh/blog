## What is Delta Lake?

In the past there are different storage solutions build to solve the common problem of data quality. Many architecture/tools are build to solve the problem. These tools provides many benefits like decoupling the business logic from storage and compute. It means user can scale the compute and storage power up and down but in between this data reliability lost. To provide the data reliability and quality  Delta Lake come into the picture.

Delta Lake combine the both worlds OLAP(Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP(Online Transactional Processing) with the horizontal scalability of data lakes.

As previously noted, over time, there have been different storage solutions built to solve this problem of data quality - from databases to data lakes. The transition from databases to data lakes had the benefit of decoupling business logic from storage as well as the ability to independently scale compute and storage. But lost in this transi‚Äê tion was ensuring data reliability. Providing data reliability to data lakes led to the development of Delta Lake.
