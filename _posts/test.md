let's first try to understand what is **Data Warehouse** and **Data Lake** and understand will Data Lake & Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) coexist?

### Data Warehouse
Data Warehouse (DW) is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources.

In the early days of data repository, a **data warehouse** (**DW** or **DWH**), also known as an **enterprise data  warehouse** (**EDW**), is a commonly known system used for **reporting** and **data analysis** and is considered a core component of **business intelligence**, **Extract transform load** (ETL). They store current and historical data in one single place.
