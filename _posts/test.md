Data lakes can hold a tremendous amount of data, and companies need ways to reliably perform update, merge and delete operations on that data so that it can remain up to date at all times. With traditional data lakes, it can be incredibly difficult to perform simple operations like these, and to confirm that they occurred successfully, because there is no mechanism to ensure data consistency. Without such a mechanism, it becomes difficult for data scientists to reason about their data.
