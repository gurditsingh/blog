## Problem
Nowadays the schema of the data is constantly evolving and changing because of business needs. To cater all the business requirements and problems the system should constantly evolving the schema and validate the schema. We need some system which validate and evolve the schema because the data is changing very frequently.

## Solution

Delta Lake has good ways to control how schema changes. With Delta Lake, users have access to simple semantics to control the schema of their tables. Delta Lake facilitates schema management out of the box with two features i.e Schema Enforcement and Scheme Evolution.
