## Problem
Data lakes holds large amount of data, and on these data needs to perform updates, merge and delete over the times. With the traditional data lakes it difficult to perform such a simple operations. So that the user need to build there own strategy to perform these operations but in this approach data consistency is big threat, and it can become very difficult for data engineering and data scientists to reason about their data.
