## Azure Synapse

Azure Synapse Analytics is a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resourcesâ€”at scale. Azure Synapse brings these worlds together with a unified experience to ingest, explore, prepare, manage and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.

 - **Azure Synapse Studio :** This tool is a web-based tool that provides developers to work with every aspect of Synapse Analytics from a single console. In this generally starts with creating a workspace and launching this tool that provides access to different synapse features like Ingesting data using import mechanisms or data pipelines and create data flows, explore data using notebooks, analyze data with spark jobs or SQL scripts, and finally visualize data for reporting and dashboarding purposes.
 - **Azure Synapse Data Integration :** This service comes with an integrated orchestration engine that is identical to Azure Data Factory to create data pipelines and rich data transformation capabilities within the Synapse workspace itself. Key features include support for 90+ data sources that include Azure-based data sources, open-source and cross-cloud data warehouses and databases, file-based data sources, No SQL based data sources, etc.
 - **Synapse SQL Pools :** This feature of the service available in a provisioned manner where a fixed capacity of DWU units is allocated to the instance of the service for data processing. Data can be imported into Synapse using different mechanisms like SSIS, Polybase, Azure Data Factory, etc.

	Synapse SQL feature is also available in a serverless manner, where no fixed capacity of the infrastructure needs to be provisioned. Instead, Azure manages the required infrastructure capacity to meet the needs of the workloads.
- **Apache Spark for Azure Synapse :** This component of Synapse provides Spark runtime to perform the same set of tasks like data loading, data processing, data preparation, ETLs, and other tasks that are generally related to data warehousing. Azure provides Data Bricks, too, as a service that is based on Spark runtime with a certain set of optimizations,
