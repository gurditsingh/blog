## What is Synapse SQL pool?
Synapse SQL Pool (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) is an MPP Enterprise Data Warehouse on Azure.

-  Synapse SQL pool stores data in relational tables with columnar storage.
-  Synapse SQL pool has compute separate from storage which enables to scale.
-  Synapse Service Level Objective (Compute) is the scalability setting which determines cost and performance of the data warehouse (DWU). It ranges from DW100c to DW30000c, higher configuration has more nodes.
-  Workload management is additional feature around managing resource utilization, concurrency and query priority.
-  Synapse compute can be scale up down via SQL, PowerShell and Portal. The SQL ability for scaling is unique, and can be achieved via an “ALTER” command.
