let's first try to understand what is **Data Warehouse** and **Data Lake** and understand will Data Lake & Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) coexist?

**Data Warehouse :** (DW) is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources.

In the early days of data repository, a **data warehouse** (**DW** or **DWH**), also known as an **enterprise data  warehouse** (**EDW**), is a commonly known system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence, Extract transform load (ETL) and [extract, load, transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform) (E-LT) are the two main approaches used to build a data warehouse system. DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place.
